    <h1>Elias Scheer</h1>
    <p>Elias Scheer is a postdoctoral researcher in Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine, working with Dr. Conor Liston. He received his Ph.D. from the Rockefeller University under the supervision of Dr. Cori Bargmann.</p>
    
    <p>In his doctoral studies, Scheer investigated how internal states influence decision-making in animal behavior. His research demonstrated how arousal states in <i>C. elegans</i> affect foraging decisions across multiple timescales. His work revealed that sensory neurons responsive to both internal and external cues play an integrative role in arousal and foraging decisions, providing insight into the neural mechanisms that regulate behavior.</p>
    
    <p>While studying behavioral state changes in <i>C. elegans</i>, Scheer became interested in investigating persistent internal states in human psychiatric conditions. In his postdoctoral research with Dr. Liston, he studies the biological basis of depression and recovery, focusing on how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment affects physiological and affective changes in patients. His current work examines proteomic signatures that accompany changes in mood and behavior, which may reveal how metabolic and immune signaling pathways contribute to psychiatric states.</p>
